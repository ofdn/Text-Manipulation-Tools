# Paragraph-to-Sentence Converter for Odia

*Paragraph-to-Sentence Converter* helps convert a paragraph into a series of sentences that end with a full stop, a question mark, an exclamation mark, or a semi-colon. This tool can be useful if you have a large block of text that you want to break down into smaller sentences, designed keeping in mind the [Mozilla Common Voice Sentence Collector](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/sentence-collector/#/en).

## How to Use

1.  Download the Paragraph-to-Sentence Converter. Open using any browser (Firefox and Brave/Chromium tested).
2.  Enter your paragraph in the "Enter your paragraph here" text area.
3.  Click the "Convert" button to convert your paragraph into sentences.
4.  The converted sentences will be displayed in the "Converted Text" area.
5.  If you want to copy the converted text, click the "Copy Converted Text" button.
6.  Paste the copied text into your desired place.

## Notes

-   The converter assumes that the input paragraph is in the Odia script. You need to manipulate the code in case it doesn't work for another writing system of your choice.
-   The converter recognizes sentence-ending punctuation marks such as _Purnachheda_ (।), full stop (.), question mark (?), exclamation mark (!), and semi-colon (;) as the end of a sentence.
-   The converter replaces all occurrences of the _Purnachheda_ (।), full stop (.) and semi-colon (;) with the Odia script's sentence-ending punctuation mark (।).
-   The converter removes any inline citation marks that look like [୧] or [୨]. Useful if the text is copied from Wikipedia.
-   The converted sentences may not always be perfect, so it is recommended to manually review and edit after conversion.
