This tool helps prepare text for [Lingua Libre](https://lingualibre.org/), a platform for recording pronunciations of words and phrases in different languages. The tool was created keeping in mind the Odia language, written in the Odia script. Text collected from various sources can be cleaned up by removing punctuation, duplicates and words in Latin script, and sorted alphabetically. Lastly, words/phrases are joined with a hash sign `#` sign, as Lingua Libre requires that during input of a large batch.

How to Use:

1.  Enter your text into the "Input Text" box.
2.  Click the "1. Remove punctuation & words to new line" button to remove punctuation and words, leaving only individual words on separate lines.
3.  Click the "2. Remove Latin character words" button to remove any words that contain Latin characters (i.e., characters not commonly found in non-Latin-based languages).
4.  Click the "3. Remove duplicates" button to remove any duplicate words from your list.
5.  Click the "4. Sort alphabetically" button to sort your list of words in alphabetical order.
6.  Click the "5. Replace lines with #" button to replace line breaks with the "#" symbol, which is used as a separator on the Lingua Libre platform.
7.  Your cleaned-up list of words will now be displayed in the "Output Text" box.
8.  Click the "Copy text" button to copy the cleaned-up list of words to your clipboard.
9.  Go to [Lingua Libre RecordWizard](https://lingualibre.org/wiki/Special:RecordWizard). Log in and approve mic access. You can then directly paste the copied words into a field below "List of words to record".

Notes:

-   This tool is designed to clean up lists of words for use on the Lingua Libre platform. It may need tweaking for other purposes.
-   The tool only works with text input in the "Input Text" box. It cannot process text input in any other format.
-   The tool may not be 100% accurate in removing Latin characters or duplicates, so it's always a good idea to double-check your output.
